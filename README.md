# WebGPU Dev Extension

This is an extension to do some experiments with WebGPU. At the moment it's
mostly for exploration but maybe someday it will morph into something useful.

## Options

* Force Mode

  Lets you choose one of 'none', 'low-power', 'high-performance', and  'compatibility-mode'

* Dump Shaders

  Dumps the pages shaders

* Emulate Compat

  Experiment to show what places would fail in compatibility mode

* Capture

  Attempt to capture WebGPU calls to an HTML file using [webgpu_recorder](https://github.com/brendan-duncan/webgpu_recorder)
